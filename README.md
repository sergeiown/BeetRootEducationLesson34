# Drugstore shopping list.

## This application is a variation of the shopping list with additional functionality. The app has been developed for training purposes.

Functionality:

- Generation of composite product names with real names added. The names are unique.
- Generation of an initial shopping list of random length with unique data. Total amount calculation and amount to be paid calculation.
- Ability to change each product's status to "bought" and "not bought". Cancellation before confirmation is possible.
- The ability to remove products with "not bought" status from the list. Cancellation before confirmation is possible.
- Sorting the shopping list by any available product parameter.
- Filtering of the shopping list by any of the available product parameters and all available parameter values. The lists of parameter values are changed each time the data in the shopping list is changed.
- Adding a new product to the current shopping list. Normalization of uppercase and lowercase letters when entering a product name. Validation of the new product data entry form. Changing the data of an existing product if the name and price of the new product are identical to the existing product. Products matching only one parameter are not identical. The length of the purchase list is limited to 11 items and cannot be exceeded.
